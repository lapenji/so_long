So_Long is a project from the 42 coding school that involves building a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX library. The objective of the game is to collect all the collectibles while avoiding obstacles and enemies.

To try it download and install [minilibx-linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) in a minilibx-linux folder in the root directory of this repository.
